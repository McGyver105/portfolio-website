        <p>Opening this link will take you to the api server homepage which will serve a json object. This object contains discriptions of the current endpoints available on this api. Over time these endpoints will be added to, and eventually will become the basis for a frontend website that accesses this api based on the type of request sent.</p>

        <p>Meanwhile this link will take you to my github account page. As new projects are completed, this is where you can access the public git repositories. Once the Northcoders Web Development courses finishes, I hope to start new projects to practice what I've learnt.</p>
        <p>I'm especially proud of finishing the higher order functions katas. These really foxed me the first time we met them, but after a lot of hard work, I've more or less got my head around the concepts.</p>

        <p>And this page that you're reading now is something that I started during the pre-course before joining Northcoders. I'm now coming back to it and adding content as it gets completed. Just maintaining this site is teaching me a lot about HTML elements and CSS styling, something we're taking forward in the next stage of the course as we learn about frontend frameworks like React.</p>
