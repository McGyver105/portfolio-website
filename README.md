#My personal portfolio

This repository contains the files used in the creation of my own personal portfolio html website. Feel free to browse the files contained within.

The portfolio site itself can be accessed directly at the following link where it is being hosted by the lovely people at Github.

One this page you'll find a navigation bar taking you to my projects page along with contact details and a link to my social media.

The site itself was put together with simple html. In future I hope to create a more responsive and interactive site using React, but that is a project for another day once I've finished the Northcoders Bootcamp. For now this site acts as a central hub where I can showcase some of the smaller projects that I've been so far involved in.
